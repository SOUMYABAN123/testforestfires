## Algerian Data set ML Prediction:
The Algerian Forest Fires dataset is a popular machine-learning dataset used for regression (Fire Weather Index prediction) or classification (Fire vs. No Fire).
I can help you build a full ML prediction pipeline — but I need to know exactly what you want.

Before that, here is a quick outline of what you can do with it.

## ✅ Typical ML Tasks on the Algerian Dataset
# 1. Regression Task

Predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using features like:

Temperature

RH (Relative Humidity)

Ws (Wind speed)

Rain

FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI (fire indices)

# 2. Classification Task

Predict whether a day is:

Fire

Not Fire

## ✅ Common Models Used

Linear Regression / Ridge / Lasso (Regression)

Random Forest Regression or Classifier

XGBoost / LightGBM

SVM

Neural Networks
